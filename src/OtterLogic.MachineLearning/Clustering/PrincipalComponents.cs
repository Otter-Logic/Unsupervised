/// At six columns the job PCA is doing here is not dimensionality reduction —
/// it is <em>decorrelation and whitening</em>, plus dropping the directions a
/// structure genuinely has no variance in. A planar frame has identically zero
/// out-of-plane demand, and a column of zeros produces a singular covariance
/// that stops EM dead. Retaining by cumulative variance rather than a fixed
/// count is what makes that case handle itself.

/// free covariance is invariant to scaling a column: the fitted variance scales
/// with it and the factor cancels out of the responsibilities. An
/// eigendecomposition is not invariant — a column with more variance pulls the
/// principal axes toward itself. Weighting applied before this step changes the
/// rotation, and therefore changes the grouping.
/// </para>
